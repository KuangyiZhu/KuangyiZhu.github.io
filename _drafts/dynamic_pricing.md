### Price Elasticity
Price elasticity is calculated by taking the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. On a linear supply or demand curve (a straight line), you can use the following price elasticity formulas:[1]

s we saw previously, the demand curve has a negative slope. If a large drop in the quantity demanded is accompanied by only a small increase in price, the demand curve will appear looks flatter, or more horizontal. People would rather stop consuming this product or switch to some alternative rather than pay a higher price. A flatter curve means that the good or service in question is quite elastic.


Meanwhile, inelastic demand can be represented with a much steeper curve: large changes in price barely affect the quantity demanded.[2]
