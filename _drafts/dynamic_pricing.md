### deterministic vs. stcochastic
A deterministic model implies that given some input and parameters, the output will always be the same, so the variability of the output is null under identical conditions. Deterministic models are often used in physics and engineering because combining deterministic models always create deterministic models.

A stochastic model implies that given some input, the output may fluctuate with given properties and distribution. 

Example 1 with a theater : 
If the ticket prices are computed with the position in the theater, the day of the month and the hour of the event, then the pricing model is deterministic, because given inputs will always yield the same price.

If, however, the price takes a 5% increase when more than three people came to buy a ticket the previous hour, then the price becomes random (if I bought a place for the same seat, on the same day at the same hour several times, my ticket woul not have cost the same every time).

Example 2 with basic mechanics :
A scientist is trying to understand gravity and drops an apple on the ground to measure the time it is falling. If his model is deterministic, he will use the fact that the acceleration is constant and equals g (assuming that friction is neglectable) and will expect the time to fall to be exactly the same at every trial. 
tdeterministic=2Hg−−−√tdeterministic=2Hg
This doesn't look very likely, so he considers that the falling time will be the deterministic falling time he computed just before, plus or minus a certain flucuation, which he is expecting to be normally distributed, with a null mean and a variance he can compute from his trials.  
We now have : 
tstochastic=tdeterministic+σ⋅Ztstochastic=tdeterministic+σ⋅Z 
With Z∼N(0,1)Z∼N(0,1) 
Example of stochastic models are Markov chains, on which you can read here (the video in the ansers is great to get a good idea). 

### Price Elasticity
Price elasticity is calculated by taking the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. On a linear supply or demand curve (a straight line), you can use the following price elasticity formulas:[1]

s we saw previously, the demand curve has a negative slope. If a large drop in the quantity demanded is accompanied by only a small increase in price, the demand curve will appear looks flatter, or more horizontal. People would rather stop consuming this product or switch to some alternative rather than pay a higher price. A flatter curve means that the good or service in question is quite elastic.


Meanwhile, inelastic demand can be represented with a much steeper curve: large changes in price barely affect the quantity demanded.[2]

The elasticity of demand is the same at every point along a constant elasticity demand curve. Panel a of the figure shows five constant elasticity demand curves. A perfectly inelastic demand curve, where e = 0 everywhere, is a vertical straight line. The next most vertical demand curve in the figure is also inelastic, with a demand elasticity of -1/3 everywhere. The unitary elasticity, e = -1, demand curve is flatter than the inelastic demand curves. As the elasticity becomes more negative (such as the e = -3 demand curve), the demand curves become flatter. The demand curve that is completely flat is perfectly elastic.[3]
