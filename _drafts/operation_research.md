### dynamic programming vs. greedy 
Both Greedy and dynamic programming algorithms construct an optimal solution of a subproblem based on optimal solutions of smaller subproblems. However, the main difference is that greedy algorithms have a local choice of the subproblem that will lead to an optimal answer. On the other hand, dynamic programming would solve all dependent subproblems and then select one that would lead to an optimal solution.

A recent overview on methods of automating the heuristic design process
is given in [2,5]. In general we can split the heuristic design process into two
parts; the first being the actual heuristic h or operator used to modify or create
instance1 x ∈ X, the second part being the heuristic policy π(φ(x), h), the
probability of selecting h, where φ(x) are features of instance x, in the simplest
